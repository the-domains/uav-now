We use the 3D Robotics Solo Drone as our main aerial platform.  It is lightweight, versatile and the 'smartest' drone on the market.  

It allows us to pre-program flight paths which can perform smooth cable-cam shots or can be used for mapping and surveys.

Armed with the latest offering from GoPro we can capture fast paced action shots in 4K resolution, or high frame rate HD footage which can be slowed down.

We can also get some great still frame shots and fantastic landscape views from the skies with the wide angle lens.

The Solo is the only quadcopter that currently gives full control over the GoPro from the ground.  This gives us the capability to change our shooting configuration rapidly without having to land the drone.  We also have the ability to view the footage the camera is capturing in real-time from the ground through First Person View (FPV), this allows us to ensure we are capturing great footage.  You can direct your own aerial movie if you would like to.  If required, we can output the live video in HD to an external display via HDMI for on-site surveys or live events.
