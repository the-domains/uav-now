# FAQ

Please see our FAQs for answers to your questions. If you still have question then please dont hesitate to **[Contact Us][0]**.

# Are you fully licensed and insured?

Yes. We are approved and have a Permission For Aerial Work (PFAW) from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), who are the governing body for the UK. We are also fully insured with £5m public liability cover. Our pilots are experienced operators and safety always comes first.

# How much do you charge for a project?

We will happily take on a project of any scale. Therefore we can only price on an individual basis. No job is the same and has many factors for us to consider. We always have pre-flight planning to do and in most cases post editing work to get our footage perfect for the customer. Just because we fly sky-high it doesn't mean our prices are, we pride ourselves on offering highly competitive prices and will be sure to give good value for money. Please don't hesitate to contact us.

# What weather conditions can you fly in?

The weather is our nemesis. Unfortunately we cannot fly in rain but who wants watery shots anyway.... The wind can also on occasion cause us problems. Our aircraft is incredibly stable and can handle windy conditions but we are limited to around 25 knots. This does vary slightly depending on the task and how closely we will be flying to buildings, people and tress etc.

# How far and how high can you fly?

Our current PFAW allows to fly to a maximum altitude of 400ft (120m). This can be extended but requires and exception by the CAA based on the location and other factors (400ft is pretty high). It can be done but needs advanced notice and planning. We can fly to a maximum distance of 500m away, giving as 1km radius. We are required to keep the aircraft in visual line of sight at all times. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f978155e-03f9-4cb0-9531-fa50b8486be1.jpg)
