  Here’s a video I produced and filmed in the village of Rushlake Green, East
  Sussex.  I was asked by the Little Arts Festival organiser to produce a video
  showing one of the festival founders playing a song they’re recorded in the
  middle of the festival logo.  The logo was mowed into a field behind the
  village hall which is to be the venue for the week long festival.
